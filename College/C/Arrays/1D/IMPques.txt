Insert an element into an array at a given index
To delete given element and decrement size of array  
To delete the element whose index is given
To find number of duplicate elements and which element is duplicated in the given array

Hard

To sort the array with respect to sum of the digits of each element 
To find the element which is duplicated max number of time continously 
(11212122211 so answer is 2 as it is duplicated 3 times)
To generate secret pin from array of n elements(Secret pin is 4 digit number)
Consider two arrays where first array contains age and second array contains insurance 
premium (in lakhs). Whose age is more there premium is more ( Don't use sorting)
To generate secret pin from n given elements (Secret pin is a three digit number)
sum of all even index elements is first digit and sum of all even element is 2 digit and remaaining sum 
is third digit. (If number is multidigit make it single digit by adding them again - 129=1+2+9=12=1+2=3)
